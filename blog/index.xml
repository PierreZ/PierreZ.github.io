      <description>Student? No more! Student? No more! Here we are! I graduate this October 2016 from my engineering school. This is an important step, and it’s always interesting to take stock.
CIR at ISEN Brest As a student, I was involved in a cursus called CIR, and it was the beginning of everything. By taking a more technical approach compared to a classical french preparatory class, I laid the foundation of my technical knowledge.</description>

      <description>Event-Driven architecture 101 Do your own cover on http://dev.to/rly
tl;dr: Queue messaging are cool. Use them at the core of your architecture.
I’m currently playing a lot around Kafka and Flink at work. I also discovered Vert.x at my local JUG. All three have a common word: events. Event-driven architecture is not something that I learned at school, and I think that’s a shame. It’s really powerful and useful, especially in a world where we speak more and more about “serverless” and “micro services” stuff.</description>

      <description>In the last two years, there’s been a technology that became really hype. It was the graal for easy deployments, easy applications management. Let’s talk about containers.
“Write once, run everywhere” When I first heard about containers, I was working as a part-time internship for a french bank as a developer in a Ops team. I was working around Hadoop and monitoring systems, and I was wondering “How should I properly deploy my work?</description>

      <description>As you may or may not know, Golang is a new programming language created by Google. It’s great for writing high-performance, concurrent server applications and tools. With it, you can easily write your own web server to render your static HTML files, or go deeper and create a REST services.
package main import &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; func main() { fmt.Println(&amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;) }  Go’s Hello World
Go has many advantages over languages like good-old Java, C++ or add your favorite language here.</description>
