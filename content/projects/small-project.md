I've always wanted to play with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), but I couldn't find a easy project to get started. Then, one day, I was doing some git manipulations and I was googling the exact syntax to add an upstream repo. **Why is it not configured by default on a forked project?** That's why i created addUpstream, a small rust utility that is automaticly adding upstreams remotes using Github API.

You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/PierreZ/addUpstream).
