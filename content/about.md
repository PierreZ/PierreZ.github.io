Hi! My name is Pierre Zemb, and I'm a **software Engineer** working at **[OVH](https://www.ovh.com)** on **[Metrics Data Platform](https://www.ovh.com/fr/data-platforms/metrics/)**.

I'm spending my days playing with **[Warp 10 Platform](http://www.warp10.io/)** and numerous projects from **[The Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/)**.

Previous work experience are including working with: **Hadoop, HBase, Kafka, Thrift, Flink, Phoenix, gRPC, Warp10, Docker, OpenStack**...

I like to **share my knowledge through talks during events**, or as a **teaching assistant** in my former school ISEN Brest.

I am the co-leader of the **[local Google Developer Group](https://gdgfinistere.org/)**, **[Java User Group](http://finistjug.fr/)**. I'm also involved in **[La Cantine Brestoise](http://www.lacantine-brest.net/)**, **[Devoxx4Kids](http://www.lacantine-brest.net/event/devoxx4kids-brest/)**, **[Brest Startup Weekend](http://brest.startupweekend.org/)**.
