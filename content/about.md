Hi! My name is Pierre Zemb, and I'm a **software engineer working at OVH**. My everyday job is about **distributed systems, scalability, open-source software and Time Series** at [Metrics Data Platform](https://www.ovh.com/fr/data-platforms/metrics/).

I'm spending my days working around the [Warp 10 Platform](http://www.warp10.io/) and numerous projects from [The Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

I'm the co-organizer of several events in Brest, such as:

* [FinistJUG](http://finistjug.fr)
* [GDG Finist√®re](http://gdgfinistere.org)
* [Brest Startup Weekend](http://brest.startupweekend.org)
* [Devoxx4Kids Brest](http://www.lacantine-brest.net/event/devoxx4kids-brest/)

I'm also a teacher assistant in my former school ISEN Brest.
