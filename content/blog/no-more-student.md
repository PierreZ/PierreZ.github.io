# Student? No more!


### Student? No more!

Here we are! I graduate this October 2016 from my engineering school. This is an important step, and it’s always interesting to take stock.

### CIR at ISEN Brest

As a student, I was involved in a cursus called [CIR](http://www.isen.fr/formations/troisieme-annee/cycle-informatique-et-reseaux-cir/), and it was the beginning of everything. By taking a **more technical approach** compared to a classical french preparatory class, I laid the foundation of my technical knowledge. I learned many things such as:

*   C and C++
*   Java
*   HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
*   PHP
*   Databases
*   Linux-based systemes
*   Cisco-based courses: Network Basics/Routing and Switching/Scaling Networks (CCNA 1–2–3–4)

### First part-time internship: Crédit Mutuel Arkéa

Thanks to the CIR, I was able to do a **part-time internship** (alternance) in my third year out of five. I worked on [Artimon](http://www.slideshare.net/Mathias-Herberts/20111109-artimonapache-flumemeetupfinal2), a **Scalable metrics collection and analysis framework built by a former Googler** with technologies like **Hadoop, Flume, Kafka and Zookeeper**. It was awesome to work on this type of stack as a first job experience.

### Second part-time internship: OVH

After a internship at Wroclaw in Poland, I started a new job at **OVH**. The subject was still related to time series, but at a much larger scale. I worked with **Go, Java, gRPC, Flink, Kafka, HBase and Phoenix** as a daily basis. I also worked on security, especially on the **CVE monitoring**.

### Getting involved in Brest

By giving a hand on many events such as the [Brest Startup Weekend](http://brest.startupweekend.org/) or for the meetings of the [FinistJUG](http://finistjug.fr/)/[GDG Finistère](http://gdgfinistere.org/), **I learned a lot** and created a **quite reasonnable network**. I also **became a speaker with talks about Docker and Go**.

### Tomorrow

Tomorrow, I’ll be working at OVH on the [Paas TimeSeries](https://www.ovh.com/fr/dbaas/timeseries/) product as a developer. I have the feelings that I’m just getting started, and I feel awesome about it!
